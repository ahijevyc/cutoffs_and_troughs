    - Tracks analysis features in serial (from the first valid time to the last), run on an interactive casper node.
    - User can set normalization values for the penalty terms (some testing configurations are provided).
    - The current configuration is “pmax1.5_2stdnorms_munozDmax1200_oppmax700” and is based on normalization values used by Lupo et al. (2023)
    - The list of analysis/verification time files is provided to the Fortran code, which outputs .track files
    - [track_analysis.f90](scripts/track_analysis.f90)
      - This Fortran code tracks analysis-time features. See .f90 file for comments.  
    - `track_analysis`
      - Compiled track_analysis.f90. This code is run using `driver_TrackAnalysis.csh`
  - `driver_TrackForecast.csh`
    - Driver script to run `run_TrackForecast.csh` and track_forecast.f90
    - Submit batch jobs to track forecast features for from f000-f240 for each initial time during each month. Submit each month as a separate casper job
    - User can set normalization values for the penalty terms (some testing configurations are provided. The current configuration is “pmax1.5_2stdnorms_munozDmax1200_oppmax700” and is based on normalization values used by Lupo et al. (2023)
    - The list of analysis/verification time files is provided to the Fortran code, which outputs .track files
    - `run_TrackForecast.csh`   
      - Submits the compiled Fortran code `track_forecast` with several command line arguments. 
      - All forecast files matching a use-specified file naming convention are added to a list, and the list is provided to `track_forecast`. 
      - The list of valid-time track files is subset to find the valid time files corresponding to the forecast hours being submitted to the Fortran code. This subset of the verification data is also submitted to track_forecast
      - The list of fx/verification files is provided to the Fortran code, which outputs .track files
      - See Fortran code for documentation
  - `utility_MergeLists.csh`
    - For cleaner organization and to more easily aggregate metrics for a specific forecast hour, this utility merges all track files valid at a specified fhhh (note that all header/column label information is also removed)
    - User sets which experiment is being merged, and which set of forecast hours the utility should iterate over.

## General order of operations:

  1. Run `driver_IdentifyFeatures.csh` for analysis/verif data and `driver_IdentifyFeatures_cases.csh` for forecast data (order does not matter here). This will generate .dat files of feature characteristics (and optional debugging netcdf files)
  2. Run “track_analysis” code. This assigns IDs to all verification features and adds tracking information to new .track files (for the verification data, “error” columns are still included, but set to missing values for consistency with the forecast .track files). This code must be run prior to `track_forecast`, as `track_forecast` uses the ID information and feature characteristics from the verification dataset to match forecast and verification features (for computing forecast errors)
  3. Run “track_forecast” code. This matches forecast and verification features at the initial time, and tracks forecast features through subsequent fhours. Features that are not tracked from the initial time are attempted to be matched to verification features at the corresponding valid time, and then are subsequently tracked.
  4. Merge lists. For ease of aggregating data to compute forecast errors as a function of forecast lead time.
- For GFS analyses and forecasts from Jan 2015–August 2022, the above steps are completed, with the output stored in `~klupo/work_new/postdoc/kasugaEA21/version9/HGT_500mb` and `~klupo/work_new/postdoc/kasugaEA21/version9/HGT_500mb/longlists`

      -	Identify features. The end result of running this script is a list of .dat files for each initial time and forecast hour (41 x itimes; 0, 6,…,240)
    	- For each case, forecast length, and forecast hour
        - `run_IdentifyFeatures_cases.csh`
        -	Receives DDIR, FHOUR, and FLEN from the driver.

            -	Refer to comments in the code for documentation. Also see Lupo et al. (2023) and Kasuga et al. (2021)
            -	Output of UFS feature scheme is swapped latitude order from GFS verif. Shouldn’t be a problem though, I don’t think the Fortran code cares which order the features are read in.
              -	`identification_algorithm_globe_cases`
                -	Compiled identification_algorithm_globe_noDisambigSteps_cases.f90. This code is run using a combination of `driver_IdentifyFeatures_cases.csh` `run_IdentifyFeatures_cases.csh`.

    - The list of analysis/verification time files is provided to the Fortran code, which outputs .track files

        -	Symlink verif track data (GFS analyses) to case directory. Also symlink the f000 forecast at the initial time as a substitute UFS f000 forecast (should be basically identical, but UFS doesn’t output data at f000, and Fortran code expects the first .dat file to be filled with analysis time features)
        -	Submits the compiled Fortran code `track_forecast_cases`  with several command line arguments. 
        -	All forecast files matching a use-specified file naming convention are added to a list, and the list is provided to track_forecast. 
        -	The list of valid-time track files is subset to find the valid time files corresponding to the forecast hours being submitted to the Fortran code. This subset of the verification data is also submitted to track_forecast
        -	The list of fx/verification files is provided to the fortran code, which outputs .track files
        -	See Fortran code for documentation
        -	track_forecast_cases.f90
            -	Fortran code to track/match forecast features. 
            -	Reads both UFS fx and GFS vx files

    * Saved value referring to how long (hours) this feature track lasts for in the entire dataset
    * Can be used to determine if a feature is `non transient` e.g., part of a track that lasts for at least 36 hours
    * Value is -9999.9 if the forecast feature is not a match for any analysis feature
    * Treat as floating point value
43. `PTY-OVR`
    * Ignore the `-OVR` part of this variable name
    * For features that are tracked, this is the tracking penalty term
    * For features that are matched, this is the matching penalty term
    * 9999.9 for forecast features that do not correspond to verifying track
    * Treat as floating point value
44. `FERRY(km)`
    * Meridional displacement error (km) of the forecast feature
    * -99999.9 for forecast features that do not correspond to verifying track
    * Treat as floating point value
45. `FERRX(km)`
    * Zonal displacement error (km) of the forecast feature
    * -99999.9 for forecast features that do not correspond to verifying track
    * Treat as floating point value
46. `FERR(km)`
    * Total displacement error (km) of the forecast feature
    * -99999.9 for forecast features that do not correspond to verifying track
    * Treat as floating point value
47. `T(0)/M(1)/N`
    * Flag to determine if a forecast feature is a continuation of a forecast track (0), was matched to a verification feature (1), or does not correspond to a verification feature (-1)
48. `VLat(N)`
    * Latitude of the corresponding verification feature (position of optimal slope), north is positive
    * -9999.9 if no corresponding verification feature
    * Treat as floating point value
49. `VLon(E)`
    * Longitude (degrees east) of the corresponding verification feature (position of the optimal slope)
    * -9999.9 if no corresponding verification feature
    * Treat as floating point value
50. `VSo`
    * Optimal slope of the corresponding verification feature feature with units of m/100km
    * -9999.9 if no corresponding verification feature
    * Treat as floating point value
51. `VRo`
    * Optimal radius of the corresponding verification feature (km)
    * -9999.9 if no corresponding verification feature
    * Treat as floating point value
52. `VZmin`
    * Local height min of the corresponding verification feature (m)
    * -9999.9 if no corresponding verification feature (of if a Trough)
    * Treat as floating point value
